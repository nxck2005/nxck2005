> *Science isn't about **why** - it's about **why not**. **Why** is so much of our science dangerous? Why not **marry** safe science if you love it so much? In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you in the butt on the way out, because **you are fired!** Not you, test subject. You're doing fine. [to someone else] Yes, **you**. Box. Your stuff. Out the front door. Parking lot. Car. Goodbye.*
